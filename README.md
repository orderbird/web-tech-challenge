A challenge for potential new orderbird web developers

Welcome to the Orderbird Tech Challenge :-). You need to setup and develop the following super small website.

# The Goal: get leads from potential customers
We need a web page where potential new orderbird customers can leave their name, email and telephone number, this data will then be stored in a data base.
Also we need a simple admin page which is only accessible via a username and password. 

The Website should be based on the PHP framework Laravel and LESS. For your convinience we have created a vagrant file to  

The deliverable should be a publicly accessible repository containing the application and a README file containing at least a guide on how to run the application.

Some guidelines:
- Your solution should be able to scale for a larger purpose. Thus imagine the app being extended to cover a larger API
 and/or a bigger feature set.
- please write tests (yes, seriously, it is important to us)
- Showcase your abilities, and use the task to demonstrate your idea of best practices, regarding coding style, project
 structure, frameworks, patterns, design, etc.
- There is no right or wrong solution, as long as it is your solution.
- if you only have time to do one thing please do it as good as you possible can. It is better to have an nice but incomplete solution rather than a mediocre "feature complete" one. We want to get a good impression of your abilities.
- Be prepared to describe your work in detail.
